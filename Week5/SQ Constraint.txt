Common Types of SQL Constraint:

Primary Key: A PK does not allowed the duplicate and null entry,  A single table can have only
single primary key.

Foreign Key: A FK constraint is used to create a relationship between two table (referential integrity), A FK column of one table must match a value in the primary key or unique key column of another table.

Not Null: I will not allowed not null in the column.

Unique: In a column all the values should be unique or distinct.

Check: It will ensures that all values in a column should be satisfy a specific condition.

Default : Using this we can set a default value for a column when no value is specified during the data insertion.
